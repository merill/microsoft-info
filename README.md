# Microsoft First Party App Names

## 💡 Overview

Looking up the names of Microsoft first party applications can be quite tricky. Microsoft publishes a static list of the common app names in the [Verify first-party Microsoft applications in sign-in reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/verify-first-party-apps-sign-in) doc.

There are a few problems with this.

* It is in markdown and is not easily consumable by scripts and KQL queries that need to perform lookups.
* It does not list all of the Microsoft apps that can be found through Microsoft Graph API.

## 🖥️ The solution

This repository provides an up-to-date list of Microsoft first party apps that can be easily consumed by scripts.

Use the following urls to consume this data in your scripts.

* :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: JSON → [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merill/microsoft-info/main/_info/MicrosoftApps.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merill/microsoft-info/main/_info/MicrosoftApps.json)
* :clipboard:  CSV → [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merill/microsoft-info/main/_info/MicrosoftApps.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merill/microsoft-info/main/_info/MicrosoftApps.csv)
